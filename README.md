A minimal, desktop and keyboard focused and performant todo app with multiple lists.

## ‚ö° Functionality

- My primary goal was to create a todo app for practice and my own usage, which i can operate without a mouse and is very fast and enjoyable to use.

- You can toggle input console with a shortcut and write a command with parameters, like in a typical console. Just with the input string and based on the command parameters you have control the following arguments:

  - You can create a single **normal** todo in a list
  - You can create a single **important** todo in a list
  - You can complete / remove a **single** or **all** **todos** in a list
  - You can remove a **single** or **all** lists

<br>

- When a list doesn't exist, it gets automatically created and the item is added to it
- Data gets read and written from and in a JSON File to the NodeJS Server with the core module `fs`
- This app has currently no authentication and works only for me as a user
